# acme-company-website
A company profile website to showcase their services and cantact details


## Description
Every company needs an online portfolio that will not only tell their story, vision and mission as an organization but also tell their customers how to reach them. This reason was what inspired me to build this demo project, to mimick wthe kind of solutions I look forward to helping organizations and individuals solve.
This is just for demo purposes and a real one will go with some more work and animation but I think this can serve to tell the story that **I CAN DO IT**.

This website was built with HTML, CSS, jQuery and served with Node. Just to learn how to use express to serve a website.
